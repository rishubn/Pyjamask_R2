Na, Nm, Nc : the number of complete blocks of associated data, plaintext, and ciphertextmessage, respectively
Ina, Inm, Inc : binary variables equal to 1 if the last block of the respective data type is incomplete, and 0 otherwise
NPUB[5..0] : Refers to the last five least significant binary digits in the public message number, NPUB. Used for calculating the first offset in OCB mode authenticated encryption/decryption

v1: Pyjamask128d16

a.  Design goal

Support for authenticated encryption and decryption (Hashing is not a feature of this algorithm)
Folded architecture, maximize throughput given the following constraints:
       1) < 2000 LUTs
       2) No BRAMs
       3) no DSP units

b.  Supported maximum sizes of inputs

2^16-1 Bytes

c.  Reference software implementation

https://github.com/pyjamask-cipher/pyjamask-reference-implementation
src_sw/crypto_aead/pyjamask128aeadv1/ref/

d.  Non-default values of generics and constants

None

e.  Block sizes

AD block size = 128 bites
Plaintext/Ciphertext block size = 128 bits

f.  Execution times

Execution time of authenticated encryption:
697 + NPUB[5..0] + (258*Na) + (253*Ina) + 5 + (262*Nm) + (257*Inm) + 253

Execution time of authenticated decryption:
697 + NPUB[5..0] + (258*Na) + (253*Ina) + 5 + (273*Nc) + (257*Inc) + 254

g.  Latencies

Latency of authenticated encryption:
258

Latency of authenticated decryption:
269

h.  Difference between execution times for a new key and the same key
Ignoring the influence of NPUB[5..0]

Authenticated encryption:
432

Authenticated decryption:
378
